# React Boiler Plate

I wanted to learn the basics of setting up a react app without "create-react-app". I followed both of these tutorials, then made some simple modifications:

- [Create React Project without create-react-app](https://dev.to/vish448/create-react-project-without-create-react-app-3goh)
- [An intro to Webpack: what it is and how to use it](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/an-intro-to-webpack-what-it-is-and-how-to-use-it-8304ecdc3c60/)
